These classes allow you to load and preprocess your data in a flexible and efficient manner.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use the `DataLoader` and `Batch` classes to load and batch your data:\n```\nfrom speechbrain.dataio import DataLoader, Batch\n\n# Define your data loader\ndata_loader = DataLoader(\n    data_dir='path/to/your/data',\n    batch_size=32,\n    num_workers=4,\n    shuffle=True\n)\n\n# Define your batch class\nbatch_class = Batch(\n    batch_size=32,\n    padding_value=0.0,\n    max_len=10000\n)\n\n# Load and batch your data\ndata_loader.load_data()\nbatches = data_loader.get_batches(batch_class)\n\n# Iterate over the batches\nfor batch in batches:\n    # Process the batch\n    print(batch.shape)\n    #...\n```\nIn this example, we define a `DataLoader` instance that loads data from a directory, shuffles the data, and batches it into chunks of size 32. We also define a `Batch` class that specifies the batch size, padding value, and maximum length for each batch.\n\nThe `DataLoader` instance loads the data and returns a list of batches, which we can then iterate over and process. Each batch is a NumPy array with shape `(batch_size, seq_len)`, where `seq_len` is the maximum length of the sequences in the batch.\n\nSpeechBrain also provides several built-in data loaders and batch classes that you can use to load and preprocess your data. For example, you can use the `AudioFileLoader` to load audio files, or the `TextFileLoader` to load text files. You can also customize the data loaders and batch classes to fit your specific use case.\n\nI hope this helps!

Our DynamicItemDataset inherits from torch.utils.data.Dataset and creates a dataset-interface based on a data-manifest file. The data-manifest file contains static items, such as filepaths or speaker labels. Then, dynamic items provide transformations based on the existing items (static or dynamic), as shown in the example:\n\n```\n@speechbrain.utils.data_pipeline.takes(\"file_path\")\n@speechbrain.utils.data_pipeline.provides(\"signal\")\ndef audio_pipeline(file_path):\n    return speechbrain.dataio.read_audio(file_path)\n```\n\nThis function takes an audio file path (a static item) and reads it as a tensor called \"signal\" (a dynamic item). Any library for reading audio files can be used here, including torch.audio. The evaluation order of the items is determined by a dependency graph. Users can define operations such as reading and augmenting an audio file, encoding a text label into an integer, basic text processing, etc. The dynamic items are defined in the training script and are thus directly customizable by the users.\n\nMoreover, by leveraging the PyTorch DataLoader class, these data pipelines are automatically applied in parallel across different workers.\n\nFor batching, SpeechBrain provides three strategies: sorting data by sequence length before batching, which minimizes zero-padding but sacrifices randomness in the batch creation process; dynamic batching, where sentences are clustered by length and sampled within the same cluster, a trade-off between random and sorted batching; and standard batching, where sentences are batched together without any specific consideration for sequence length.\n\nSpeechBrain also provides a PaddedBatch class, which handles the rather annoying task of padding examples together. By default, it batches together only PyTorch tensors by adding zeros to the right on the last dimension. Other data types are not batched together but, instead, are returned in a Python list. It also provides a semantically meaningful interface.\n\nIn summary, SpeechBrain handles data loading and batching for speech processing tasks by providing a flexible and modular system that can be customized by users, leveraging PyTorch's DataLoader class, and offering three batching strategies to handle variable-length sequences and complex data transformation pipelines.",
