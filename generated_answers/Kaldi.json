The process involves the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. **Language Model**: The first step is to create a language model, which is a probability distribution over the possible sentences in the language. This model is used to predict the likelihood of a sentence given a sequence of words.\r\n2. **Acoustic Model**: The next step is to create an acoustic model, which is a probability distribution over the possible phonemes given a sequence of acoustic features. This model is used to predict the likelihood of a phoneme given a sequence of acoustic features.\r\n3. ** WFST Construction**: The WFST is constructed by combining the language model and the acoustic model. The WFST represents the decoding process as a weighted finite state machine, where each state corresponds to a word or phoneme, and the weights represent the probabilities of transitioning from one state to another.\r\n4. **WFST Optimization**: The WFST is then optimized using various techniques, such as pruning and determinization, to reduce its size and improve its performance.\r\n5. **Decoding**: The final step is to use the optimized WFST to decode the input audio signal. The WFST is used to compute the most likely sequence of words or phonemes given the input audio signal, and the resulting sequence is the decoded output.\r\n\r\nThe rationale behind using WFSTs is that they provide a compact and efficient representation of the decoding process. By representing the decoding process as a weighted finite state machine, WFSTs allow for the efficient computation of the most likely sequence of words or phonemes given the input audio signal. This is particularly important in speech recognition, where the decoding process needs to be performed quickly and accurately in real-time. WFSTs also allow for the use of various optimization techniques, such as pruning and determinization, to reduce the size of the WFST and improve its performance.

The WFSTs are constructed based on the recipe described in [14], but with some differences. One important difference is in the handling of \"weight-pushing\", which is an operation that ensures the FST is stochastic.\n\nThe process begins with the construction of the decoding graph, which is based on the WFSTs. The WFSTs are used to model the probability distributions of the input symbols and the output frames. The WFSTs are constructed by mapping the transition-ids to the transition-probability parameters in the model, making the transitions as fine-grained as possible without increasing the size of the decoding graph.\n\nThe use of WFSTs in Kaldi's decoding graph construction is based on the need to ensure the FST is stochastic. Weight-pushing is an operation that is used to ensure this stochasticity. By using WFSTs, Kaldi's decoding graph construction process can handle the stochasticity of the FST, which is essential for accurate decoding.\n\nIn addition, the use of WFSTs allows for the integration of Kaldi with Finite State Transducers (FSTs), which is a key feature of Kaldi. The WFSTs are used to provide a score for a particular frame and FST input symbol, which is an important interface for Kaldi's decoders.\n\nOverall, the use of WFSTs in Kaldi's decoding graph construction is a key feature that enables the accurate decoding of speech signals and provides a flexible and extensible framework for speech recognition.",

The process is based on the recipe described in [14], but with several differences.\n\nFirst, Kaldi uses a more fine-grained integer identifier called a \"transition-id\" to encode the pdf-id, phone, and arc within the topology specification for each phone. This allows for a one-to-one mapping between the transition-ids and the transition-probability parameters in the model.\n\nThe decoding-graph construction process involves several stages, each of which aims to preserve the stochasticity of the FST. The first stage is to create a graph that represents the grammar or language model (G). This graph is then extended to include the acoustic model (AM) and the phonetic decision trees (PDTs). The extended graph is then pruned to remove any unnecessary arcs and states, which helps to reduce the size of the decoding graph.\n\nThe rationale behind using Weighted Finite State Transducers (WFSTs) in Kaldi is to ensure that the decoding graph is well-formed and that the decoding process is efficient and accurate. WFSTs allow for the representation of complex acoustic models and language models as finite state transducers, which can be combined and manipulated using standard FST operations.\n\nBy using WFSTs, Kaldi can efficiently compute the likelihood of a given sequence of observations given a model, and can also efficiently compute the most likely sequence of states given a sequence of observations. This is particularly important in speech recognition, where the decoding process needs to be fast and accurate in order to recognize spoken words and phrases.\n\nOverall, the use of WFSTs in Kaldi allows for a flexible and efficient way to represent and manipulate complex acoustic models and language models, which enables the toolkit to support a wide range of speech recognition tasks and applications.",

This is achieved by avoiding weight-pushing altogether and instead ensuring that each stage of graph creation \"preserves stochasticity\" in an appropriate sense. Informally, this means that the \"non-sum-to-one-ness\" (the failure to sum to one) will never get worse than what was originally present in G.\n\nUsing WFSTs allows Kaldi to handle context-dependent states and to share the same pdf-ids among different phones, which would otherwise lead to problems with determinizing the FSTs and having sufficient information from the Viterbi path through an FST to work out the phone sequence or to train the transition probabilities.",
