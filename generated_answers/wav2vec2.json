Self-supervised learning allows the model to learn the patterns and structures present in the speech data without requiring explicit annotations or labels, which can be time-consuming and costly to obtain. By pre-training the model on unlabeled data, it can learn to extract useful features and representations that can be fine-tuned on the target task, leading to improved performance and reduced reliance on labeled data. This approach can also help to reduce the domain shift problem, where the model is trained on a specific dataset and then deployed on a different dataset, and can improve the model's robustness to noisy and degraded speech.
